### Why virtual environment is needed
because virtual environments create local environments so that each different project can have different dependencies and packages, if you don't have any virtual environments, you can only make one project without breaking system tools or other projects.

### How i implemented it
I followed the instructions on lab 1, by creating virtual environment then changing all necessary files, then changed some names on the catalogue and style the html so that it doesn't look messy.

### Key Differences
json is used to represent objects, can't be commented, doesn't support namespaces, and doesn't use end tags.
xml is used to describe data items, can be commented, supports namespaces, dynamic, and uses end tags.
html is used to display data and does not carry it, static, limited tags that displays data, and the tags are predefined.

### Importance of Data Delivery
Typically an HTTP request response cycle is the standard data delivery procedure. The browser would request HTML, style, JPG, Javascript, and the last is the data. HTML would display the data and the data would be delivered in the form of XML and JSON. The importance of data delivery comes in when there's so much data on the website, so that it can display it in chunks based on the user's request and lighten the weight on the storage system.

### Process of Completion
Step by step process:
- Create a new app named `mywatchlist` in pbp2022_katalog
- Added mymwatchlist into project django's settings and url
- Created models for mywatchlist and migrate the models
- Make a json file containing all the data and load the data
- Create the HTML file in templates and styled it briefly
- Connect views and models and the html
- Push the code to github and deploy it on heroku
- Download and screenshotted postman accessing mywatchlist
- Edit tests.py and test the server status code
- Write readme for assignment 3 in github

### CSRF Token
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application. CRSF token is a unique value that is generated by server-side to protect CSRF vulnerable resources. If there's no {% csrf_token %}, the request will be rejected and the user session will be terminated thus the event will be identified as a CSRF attack.

### Creating Form Manually
Yes, we can create form element manually by not using .as_table altogether or using different commands such as forms.as_p or by using some outside help like bootstrap if we want to format it. By using those things we can customize the forms more freely and creatively. We can also create the form using the built in form in html but it will require more work.

### Data Flow Process
The flow of data from forms is first the user fills out the data, then it will be stored in the database model and it will be passed onto the html page. After that, it will be displayed for the user to see.

### Process of Completion
Step by step process:
- Create a new application named `todolist`
- Add `todolist` into project_django's settings and url
- Create user model using foreign key and also other models then makemigrations and migrate the model
- Implement login, register, and logout similar to lab 03
- Create button in `todolist.html` that redirects into `create-task.html`
- Create `forms.py` that contains the form that will be used
- Create new function in `views.py` that retrieves data from the form and redirects as soon as you submit the form
- Add, commit, and push the code onto GitHub then deploy the app on heroku
- Create two accounts with each having 3 tasks in the heroku app
- Answer assignment 4's question by updating READ.ME
