### Diagram
HTTP request -> urls -> (views <-> models) -> HTTP response(html)

### Why virtual environment is needed
because virtual environments create local environments so that each different project can have different dependencies and packages, if you don't have any virtual environments, you can only make one project without breaking system tools or other projects

### How i implemented it
I followed the instructions on lab 1, by creating virtual environment then changing all necessary files, then changed some names on the catalogue and style the html so that it doesn't look messy
